# a fool-proof guide to compiling 'cats!'
So, instead of paying 2USD you decided to work, just to compile a stupid game? What have humans come to? Anyways lets start. 

## dependencies
- Haxe (https://haxe.org)
- Haxeflixel (https://haxeflixel.com)
so, these are the things that you **need** to compile the game. (AKA dependencies)

## Compiling
1. Download the source code (https://gitlab.com/aaa.dev/cats/-/archive/main/cats-main.zip)
2. Extract the zip so that the structure looks something like this : (cats-main -> game files here)
3. open the terminal in your newly extracted cats-main. 
4. run this command `lime test windows` if you are on windows, and this applies to mac and linux.
