# a fool-proof guide to compiling 'cats!'
So, instead of paying 2USD you decided to work, just to compile a stupid game? What have humans come to? Anyways lets start. 

## dependencies
- Haxe (https://haxe.org)
- Haxeflixel (https://haxeflixel.com)


so, these are the things that you **need** to compile the game. (AKA dependencies)

## compiling
1. Download the source code (https://gitlab.com/aaa.dev/cats/-/archive/main/cats-main.zip)
2. Extract the zip so that the structure looks something like this : (cats-main -> game files here)
3. open the terminal in your newly extracted cats-main. 
4. run this command `lime test windows` if you are on windows, and this applies to mac and linux.

## what now? 
So, if you liked the game you can find a build of it in the `export` folder in the game files
and create a shortcut to your desktop.

## i have a problem
you can open an issue on the repo, and someone will do their best to help you.
and of course, be respectful

but if nobody can figure out the problem, its best to check the haxe discord server.  if you are going to ask a question make sure its the #flixel channel because this game was made in haxeflixel.
