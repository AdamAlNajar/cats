## What is this Game about?

The main idea is simple, but first some backstory :
- You are a middle-aged man on social media, and you like cats. 
- Your wife divorced you for _"totally"_ unknown reasons.

Your objective is to take as many pictures of cats on the streets of your city, and the cuter the pictures are, the more money you get.
