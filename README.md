# Cats! - The cat game of the future
this game is 2$ on itch.io, but if you are here you can get it for free. (im gonna write the guide later)
but please, if you like it, buy it. It helps a lot
the main idea is simple :
- see cat, 
- take picture of cat and post on catGram
- get likes on catGram
- go travel for cats
and repeat this for a long time, but beware. this game may or may not be a horror game.

# Info for the silly nerds 
this game was made in haxe using haxeflixel, you can check the 2 out below in https://gitlab.com/aaa.dev/cats/-/edit/main/README.md?ref_type=heads#L15 
compiling shouldn't be a problem if you have all the dependencies.

this game may contain elements that do bad stuff to ur body, so take the neccesary precaution. 

getting the game for free (compiling) is a bit involved so, that will be in a different file.
